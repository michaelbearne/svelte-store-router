# Store-based router for Svelte

#### Inspired by the [svelte-pathfinder](https://github.com/PaulMaly/svelte-pathfinder) by [PaulMaly](https://github.com/PaulMaly)

A completely different approach of routing. State-based router suggests that routing is just another global state and History API changes are just an optional side-effects of this state.

## Features

- Zero-config.
- Just another global state.
- It doesn't impose any restrictions on how to apply this state to the application.
- Manipulate different parts of a state (path/query/hash) separately.
- Automatic parsing of the `query` params, optional parsing `path` params.
- Helpers to work with navigation, links, and even forms.

## Install

```bash
npm i svelte-store-router --save-dev
```
